For the sake of simplified visualization, numerical results are presented for various two-dimensional problems as they originate from nondestructive testing applications. In particular, EFIT wavefronts are reIated to group velocity curves for anisotropic media with transverse isotropy and cubic symmetry, the latter one being derived by a coordinate-free approach in the appendix.},

The plate thickness and ﬂaws explored in this work include frequency–thickness regions where several Lamb wave modes exist and sometimes overlap in phase and/or group velocity. For the case of the ﬂat-bottom hole the depth was incrementally increased to explore progressive changes in multiple-mode Lamb wave scattering due to the damage. The ﬂat-bottom hole simulation results have been compared to experimental data and are shown to provide key insight for this well-deﬁned experimental case by explaining unexpected results in experimental waveforms. For the rounded rectangle disbond ﬂaw, which would be difﬁcult to implement experimentally, we found that Lamb wave behavior differed signiﬁcantly from the ﬂat-bottom hole ﬂaw. Most of the literature in this ﬁeld is restricted to low frequency–thickness regions due to difﬁculties in interpreting data when multiple modes exist. We found that benchmarked 3D EFIT simulations can yield an understanding of scattering behavior for these higher frequency–thickness regions and in cases that would be difﬁcult to set up experimentally. Additionally, our results show that 2D simulations would not have been sufﬁcient for modeling the complicated scattering that occurred.},

	abstract = {Seismic waves scattering especially waves SH by different topographies has been widely studied in the field of earthquake engineering. However, most of these studies mainly focus on the topographies with the ideal assumption (elastic, isotropic and homogeneous) of uniform medium or the first stratification type of canyon (canyon that is not crossing by layer-interfaces). Compared with SH wave scattering, there exists a challenge to derive the theoretical solution for the scattering of P or SV wave especially by relative complicated canyon with non-uniform medium, which is defined as the second stratification type or type II here. The paper focuses on the study on the two-dimensional scattering of plane P waves by a symmetrical V-shaped canyon embedded in a twolayered elastic half-plane of type II. The challenge is to deal with three issues simultaneously, namely satisfaction of boundary conditions in the vertical direction, more complex reflections and more coordinate system trans­ formations. Here more cylindrical coordinate systems and the skew coordinate transformation formulas need to be defined and used so as to satisfy the boundary conditions along the canyon surface, in which coordinate transformation and its solution process become more complex. The derived solution of symmetrical V-shaped canyon is rigorous theoretically and reliable, and further demonstrate that it is affected directly by the second layered type of symmetrical V-shaped canyon. Moreover, the effects of the layer medium, the incident fre­ quencies and incident angles on the ground motion also are investigated by the double-layer considering nonhomogeneous cases. This study shows that inhomogeneous-material, frequencies of incident waves and the existence of the canyon result in conspicuous even non-ignorable effect on variability of surface ground motions.},

	abstract = {abstract
            We study a plane circular model of a frictional fault using numerical methods. The model is dynamic since we specify the effective stress at the fault. In one model we assume that the fault appears instantaneously in the medium; in another, that the rupture nucleates at the center and that rupture proceeds at constant subsonic velocity until it suddenly stops. The total source slip is larger at the center and the rise time is also longer at the center of the fault. The dynamic slip overshoots the static slip by 15 to 35 per cent. As a consequence, the stress drop is larger than the effective stress and the apparent stress is less than one half the effective stress.
            The far-field radiation is discussed in detail. We distinguish three spectral regions. First, the usual constant low-frequency level. Second, an intermediate region controlled by the fault size and, finally, the high-frequency asymptote. The central region includes the corner frequency and is quite complicated. The corner frequency is shown to be inversely proportional to the width of the far-field displacement pulse which, in turn, is related to the time lag between the stopping phases. The average corner frequency of S waves v0s is related to the final source radius, a, by v0s = 0.21 β/α. The corner frequency of P waves is larger than v0s by an average factor of 1.5.},

To avoid critical situations, the fatigue and damage tolerance behavior of railway steels is of high importance. In this experimental study, the fatigue and fracture performance of a pearlitic Grade 900A rail steel, which is used in the railway network of Attiko Metro in Athens has been investigated. The rail material is an annealed steel with pearlitic microstructure, combining high strength with a high strain hardening rate and excellent high cycle fatigue behavior. On the other hand, the material exhibits brittle fracture characteristics with inferior fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth resistance compared to other pearlitic rail steels. The mechanical performance suggests that the material resists crack initiation, but for application purposes maintenance schedules should be able to identify fatigue cracks at early stages to avoid propagation of cracks to critical lengths compromising structural integrity.},

	abstract = {The ability to detect defects in rail, and in particular surface defects such as gauge corner cracking, is essential. Current ultrasonic testing of the rail uses contacting transducers in a send-receive mode which are at present limited in testing speed to around 20–30 mph, and signals from serious surface defects may be masked by nearby shallow surface defects. Using Rayleigh-like surface waves generated and detected in a pitch-catch manner we can overcome the effect of this masking, and by using electro-magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) working at a small standoff we may be able to lift many of the current rail testing speed limitations with a high accuracy for detecting and gauging surface defects. We present experiments on rail samples with real and machined defects, using EMATs to generate and detect a low-frequency wide-band surface wave. The depths of the defects can be characterised through analysis of both the time domain signal amplitude and frequency dependent behaviour. The design of EMAT used is discussed, with consideration of signal, frequency content, directionality of the signal and the effect of standoff above the sample.},

Prior to the experiments, simulation studies were conducted to fully understand the defect dimensions and optimized the experimental parameters. Response signal parameters, amplitude and phase were analyzed to characterize the defect features.

Internal and surface defects occur on the rail due to various combinations of causes including fatigue loading and cyclic tension and compression among others from the deterioration of the rail along with the temperature differences of seasonal changes. Surface defects such as head check, shelling, and squats start out in the rail head and become internal defects due to poor maintenance, ultimately resulting in rail failure. In order to prevent rail failure, it is important that defects are identified through nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in advance and to carry out maintenance techniques including grinding. NDE methods include MFL, EMAT, and ECT, and among these, the ECT method is a representative method with excellent detection sensitivity that nondestructively inspects metal surfaces such as rails and pipes using an electromagnetic field. Also, since the defect signal is obtained as an electrical signal, the depth, length, and width of defects can be assessed using a defect evaluation algorithm. This study investigated the field applicability and future practical use of the 16 channel eddy current testing equipment and defect evaluation algorithm developed in this study. Therefore, the field applicability of the equipment and defect evaluation algorithm was investigated through the detection of artificial defects with varying size and depth. Afterwards, future practical use was evaluated by inspection of areas of rail that are in use and with naturally occurring surface defects and analysis of their size (length, width), depth, and phenomena.},

During field trials it was found that in the detection test most of the artificial cracks were detected automatically by employing a novel combined threshold and signature match (CTSM) method. The results of the characterisation test also suggest that the system can automatically take reliable constant lift-off ACFM measurements over the cracks at close to optimum range for characterisation where the relative angle offset between the ACFM sensor and the crack is bounded to be within 5°.},

The purpose of this paper is to review techniques that utilise ultrasonic bulk waves to size ﬂaws. Flaws that are embedded within a component (i.e. remote from any surface) as well as ﬂaws growing from inaccessible surfaces are considered. The different available techniques are grouped into the following categories: amplitude, temporal, imaging and inversion. The principles, applications and limitations of the different techniques are covered, as well as approaches to assessing the performance of the techniques. Finally, remaining gaps and challenges in sizing ﬂaws, particularly in an industrial setting, are discussed.},

The basic tool is a simpliﬁed timescale projection called a dynamic wavelet ﬁngerprint (DWFP) which enables direct observation of the variation of features of interest in non-stationary ultrasonic signals. The DWFP technique was used to automatically detect and evaluate each candidate through-transmitted Lamb mode. The area of the DWFP was then used as a feature to distinguish false modes caused by noise and other interference from the true modes of interest. The set of estimated arrival times were then used as inputs for tomographic reconstruction. The Lamb wave tomography images generated with these estimated arrival times were able to indicate different defects in aluminium plates.},

	abstract = {Rail tracks undergo massive stresses that can affect their structural integrity and produce rail breakage. The last phenomenon represents a serious concern for railway management authorities, since it may cause derailments and, consequently, losses of rolling stock material and lives. Therefore, the activities of track maintenance and inspection are of paramount importance. In recent years, the use of various technologies for monitoring rails and the detection of their defects has been investigated; however, despite the important progresses in this ﬁeld, substantial research efforts are still required to achieve higher scanning speeds and improve the reliability of diagnostic procedures. It is expected that, in the near future, an important role in track maintenance and inspection will be played by the ultrasonic guided wave technology. In this manuscript, its use in rail track monitoring is investigated in detail; moreover, both of the main strategies investigated in the technical literature are taken into consideration. The ﬁrst strategy consists of the installation of the monitoring instrumentation on board a moving test vehicle that scans the track below while running. The second strategy, instead, is based on distributing the instrumentation throughout the entire rail network, so that continuous monitoring in quasi-real-time can be obtained. In our analysis of the proposed solutions, the prototypes and the employed methods are described.},
